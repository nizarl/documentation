Background:

There are 2 Yeoman generators (application and component).  They each providecode scaffolding for applications and components respectively.

In addition to scaffolding code files, the generator gives the developer the following capabilities (see commands in step 3 below):

Build, Build watch, Autogenerated component interface documentation, Lint (code syntax analysis), Test, Test coverage reporter, NPM publish component as NPM package.
The scaffolding process depends on Yeoman generator.
Install yeoman on your local machine, please reference our article: Yeoman Generator
Steps:
Install the Application and Component generator:
1. Get source code for application generator to your local machine.
2. Get source code for component generator to your local machine.
3. Type *npm link* from the root directory of each project. (application and component)


Start the generator (run the following commands from the root directory where you plan to build a component):
If you have Yeoman installed on your local machine run the following command

yo
Choose: React Application or React Component
note: for Win10, yo's UI in terminal may not respond to arrow up and down key press properly, the only option available is press ENTER to start generator selected as default.
For question 2 in the component generator (stateless vs stateful)
We have chosen a hybrid approach.  Top level component is stateful and sub-elements are functional components.

This means when you create a new component using generator choose STATEFUL.

Once installation is complete, you can run the following commands:

npm run build: builds project, runs component documentation, and runs eslint
npm run buiild:watch: run build command above in watch mode.  Therefore, each time you save a file under the /src directory the project rebuilds.
npm run start: starts project and runs local web server.
npm run test: Runs project unit tests located at ./tests directory
npm run test:coverage: Runs test coverage report and outputs to: ./coverage directory
npm run test:watch:  run test in watch mode
npm run docs: runs component documentation and outputs to ./COMPONENT-API.md
npm run lint: run eslint
npm run lint:watch: runs eslint in watch mode
npm run open:cover: Opens browser with coverage report
